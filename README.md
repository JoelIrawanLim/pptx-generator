# The issue:
During Remaja sessions, while preparing slides, the AVs have to painstakingly go about searching for scores. This is both inefficient and time-consuming, as the time spent on searching for songs is quite long. In addition, the version of the songs would not be accurate sometimes, or have incomplete/ invalid lyrics. 
# The solution:
We have come up with an app that generates powerpoint slides with music included. This can help to solve problems such having incomplete lyrics, inaccuracy and saves a lot of time.

If you are not good with terminals and just want a simple and easy setup, We recommend you to use the [Zero-setup Method](https://github.com/JoelIrawanLim/pptx-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#zero-setup-method). 

Otherwise, if you want to use it offline, the steps to install it on your computer can be found here [Install Guide](https://github.com/JoelIrawanLim/pptx-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies)

## Zero-setup method
You can use google collab to run an easy to use an already setup version of this script. 

Video Tutorial: WIP
Text Tuitorial: [Google Collab Tuitorial](https://github.com/JoelIrawanLim/pptx-generator/blob/main/collab.md#google-collab-tutorial)

Go to: [collab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lYKa7aeWkkQcBxrcUAk-ytR3sFIZ-Xew?usp=sharing)

Click on the one in brackets ([1]). It will become a run button. Do this everytime you open the link. 
Google will tell you that it is not authored by Google, click run anyway. 

You can now input you searches inside the ui and click the run button

## Installing it Locally
You can also install this script locally so that you don't require an internet connection to use it. 
Steps to do this can be found in: [Installing pptx-generator locally as a cli tool](https://github.com/JoelIrawanLim/pptx-generator/blob/main/local.md#installing-pptx-generator-locally-as-a-cli-tool)
