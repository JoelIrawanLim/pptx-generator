    - "It may bring me poverty,"
    - "But the one who feeds the sparrow,"
    - "is the one who stands by me,"
  - - "And the path that be my portion,"
    - "may be through the flame or flood;"
    - "But His presence goes before me,"
    - "And I'm covered with His blood."
  - - "Many things about tomorrow,"
    - "I don't seem to understand,"
    - "But I know who holds tomorrow,"
    - "And I know who holds my hand."
