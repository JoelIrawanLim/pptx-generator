  - - We're marching to Zion,
    - Beautiful, beautiful Zion
    - We're marching upward to Zion,
    - The beautiful city of God.
  - - The God that rules on high,
    - And thunders when He please,
    - Who rides upon the stormy sky,
    - Who rides upon the stormy sky,
    - And manages the seas,
    - And manages the seas.
  - - We're marching to Zion,
    - Beautiful, beautiful Zion
    - We're marching upward to Zion,
    - The beautiful city of God.
  - - This awful God is ours,
    - Our Father and our Love;
    - He will send down his heav'nly powers,
    - He will send down his heav'nly powers,
    - To carry us above,
    - To carry us above.
  - - We're marching to Zion,
    - Beautiful, beautiful Zion
    - We're marching upward to Zion,
    - The beautiful city of God.
  - - There we shall see His face,
    - And never, never sin!
    - There, from the rivers of His grace,
    - There, from the rivers of His grace,
    - Drink endless pleasures in,
    - Drink endless pleasures in.
