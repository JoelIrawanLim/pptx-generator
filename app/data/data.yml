  lyrics: 
  - - "O Love that will not let me go,"
    - "I rest my weary soul in Thee."
    - "I give Thee back the life I owe,"
    - "that in Thine ocean depths its flow"
    - "may richer, fuller be."
  - - "O Light that follow'st all my way,"
    - "I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee."
    - "My heart restores its borrowed ray,"
    - "that in Thy sunshine's blaze its day"
    - "may brighter, fairer be."
  - - "O Joy that seekest me thro' pain,"
    - "I cannot close my heart to Thee."
    - "I trace the rainbow thro' the rain,"
    - "and feel the promise is not vain"
    - "That morn shall tearless be."
  - - "O Cross that liftest up my head,"
    - "I dare not ask to fly from Thee."
    - "I lay in dust life's glory dead,"
    - "and from the ground there blossoms red"
    - "Life that shall endless be."

  lyrics: 
  - - "I don't know about tomorrow;"
    - "I just live from day to day,"
    - "I don't borrow from it's sunshine,"
    - "For it's skies may turn to grey,"

    - "And I know who holds my hand."
  - - "Every step is getting brighter,"
    - "as the golden stairs I climb;"
    - "Every burden's getting lighter,"
    - "every cloud is silver-lined,"
  - - "There the sun is always shining,"
    - "there no tear will dim the eye;"
    - "At the ending of the rainbow,"
    - "where the mountains touch the sky."

    - "But I know who holds tomorrow,"
    - "And I know who holds my hand."
  - - "I don't know about tomorrow;"
    - "It may bring me poverty,"
    - "But the one who feeds the sparrow,"
    - "is the one who stands by me,"
  - - "And the path that be my portion,"
    - "may be through the flame or flood;"
    - "But His presence goes before me,"
    - "And I'm covered with His blood."
  - - "Many things about tomorrow,"
    - "I don't seem to understand,"
    - "But I know who holds tomorrow,"
    - "And I know who holds my hand."
