    - A thousand sacred sweets
    - Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
    - Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
    - Or walk the golden streets,
    - Or walk the golden streets.
  - - We're marching to Zion,
    - Beautiful, beautiful Zion
    - We're marching upward to Zion,
    - The beautiful city of God.
  - - Then let our songs abound,
    - And every tear be dry;
    - We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
    - We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
    - To fairer worlds on high,
    - To fairer worlds on high.
  - - We're marching to Zion,
    - Beautiful, beautiful Zion
    - We're marching upward to Zion,
    - The beautiful city of God.
